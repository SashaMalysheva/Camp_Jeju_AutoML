# Camp_Jeju_AutoML

Nowadays, Machine learning (ML) has achieved considerable successes in several applications. In order to achieve better performance it is necessary to choose a proper machine learning algorithm on a particular data set. 
However, automatic comparison of machine learning algorithms and their hyperparameters is still an issue. At the moment, several AutoML libraries are available. Most of them are working on Python and Java, while there is no effective instrument for C++ developers [see list of ChaLearn winners]. 
Unfortunately, summer school is too short for such a global objective like AutoML extension, so, namely, I want to implement the method for combining classification algorithms, based on a Bayesian optimizer and write description about it.
## Project goals
During internship I expect to achieve:
1. Implement meta-learning algorithm suggesting some instantiations of the ML framework that are likely to perform well on processed dataset.

2. Implement Bayesian optimizer for hyperparameter optimization and classification algorithm combination.

3. Implement automated ensemble construction out of models evaluated during Bayesian optimization.

4. Compare the performance of implemented algorithm with state of the art AutoML solutions.

5. Write an API with specification and samples.
